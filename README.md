# Prediction Using Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data. As a result, unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set.
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms infer patterns from a dataset without reference to known, or labeled, outcomes.
