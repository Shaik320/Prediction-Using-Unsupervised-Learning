# TSF-GRIP-TASK-2
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data. As a result, unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set.
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms infer patterns from a dataset without reference to known, or labeled, outcomes. 
From the given Iris Dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and representing it visually.
